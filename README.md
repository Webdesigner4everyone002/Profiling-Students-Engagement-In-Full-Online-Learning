This is a Project developed  as a group including me and few of my friends.  
The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive models that anticipate students' interest in
placement opportunities within the framework of full online learning. By leveraging machine learning techniques
and conducting exploratory data analysis, the project aims to discern patterns and factors influencing students'
placement preferences.
Many Machine Learning Model Modules such as  RandomForestClassifier,LogisticRegression,KNeighborsClassifier are used .
Modules for various metrics used to evaluate machine learning model performance such as accuracy_score,confusion_matrix, roc_curve,..etc.
train_test_split Data Splitting Module Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
LabelEncoder Converts categorical variables into numerical representations.
matplotlib.pyplot,seaborn  Visualization Modules are also used.
